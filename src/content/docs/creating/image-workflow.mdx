import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This is a guide that will walk through making an image that reflects the Sunnah. This will use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) DALLE 3 to create the original image, [Adobe Firefly Generative Fill](https://firefly.adobe.com/generate/inpaint) to edit it, and finally [Adobe Express](https://new.express.adobe.com/) to add the logo.

All of these services require a paid subscription, ChatGPT plus plan is $20 USD a month, and Adobe Firefly is $10 USD a month. Adobe Express will let you use some of the features for free, but also has a paid plan for $10 USD a month.

This guide was originally posted in the Discord in [this thread](https://discord.com/channels/1114742919644074046/1234906151049494669/threads/1239629798167417052/1239629798167417052).


## Creating Initial Image with ChatGPT

<Steps>

1.  Go to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and start a DALL E chat.

2.  Enter the prompt for the image you want to create.

    ```plaintext wrap title="ChatGPT DALLE 3 Prompt"
    As salaamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh, please draw a Naqshbandi Muslim man wearing green robes and a Naqshbandi style turban sitting in an expansive field of
    roses with a moonlit pink and emerald sky
    ```

3.  You can further instruct it to refine the image after its original response.

    ```plaintext wrap title="ChatGPT DALLE 3 Follow up prompt"
    Please add the green dome of Medina to the background
    ```

4.  Save the image.

## Adding SMC Logo to image

This can be done with any photo editing software, but here we will use [Adobe Express](https://new.express.adobe.com/).

Find more options for editing software in [This section of Creating AI Images and Videos](/creating/ai-images-and-videos/#image-editing-software) article.

You can find the SMC logo and other assets on the [Images and Assets](/resources/assets/#logo) page.

<Steps>

1. Go to Adobe Express website or app and log in.

2. Upload the image you created with Adobe Firefly.

3. Find the "Add" button and upload the SMC logo

4. Add text if you want, here we added "SHAYKH.AI" text in order to hide the Buddhist hand symbol.
