### How to post

Make fresh accounts on all these platforms and post the same content on all of them. This will help to reach more people.

<Steps>

1. Get the "Hero Image" from the article which is the main image at the top of
   the article. On computer right-click it and save image as, or on phone/tablet
   take a screenshot.
2. Use the Article's exising title for your post.

3. If posting on a platform with limited characters, or unable to use links then put
   a link this link in your bio
   [https://nurmuhammad.com/latest-articles/](https://nurmuhammad.com/latest-articles/) and say "Link in bio" in your post.

   Then take the first paragraph of the article after the introduction and use it as your post.

4. If you can use links and include more paragrahps from the article then place the link to the article at the start and end of your post and post more paragraphs from the article.

</Steps>
